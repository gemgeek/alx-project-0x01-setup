#  Next.js API-Driven Web Application üöÄ

 A comprehensive web application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project demonstrates the fundamentals of modern web development, including API data fetching, dynamic page routing, state management with React hooks, and interactive modals.


 ## ‚ú® Features

 - **Dynamic Pages**: Separate pages for displaying lists of posts and users.
 - **API Integration**: Fetches initial data from the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API at build time using `getStaticProps` for optimal performance.
 - **Reusable Components**: Built with a component-based architecture, including cards, buttons, and layouts.
 - **Interactive Modals**: Includes "Add Post" and "Add User" modals for interactive user input.
 - **State Management**: Uses React's `useState` hook to manage component state, such as modal visibility.
 - **Type Safety**: Fully typed with TypeScript to ensure code quality and prevent common errors.
